\title{Mirror plot and peak group plot with raw intensity data for identified peaks
 Use m/z ang intensity of precursor and fragment ions for mirror plot and peak group plot. The left is peak group plot with all ions, the black line stands for precursor ion, and the colorful lines stand for fragment ions. The right is the mirror plot of all fragmet ions.}
